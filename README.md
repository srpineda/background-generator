# Gradient Background Generator

In this site, we can experiment on different combinations of colors for a gradient background.
* We can manually set the colors using the color selector, or 
* Randomly create a gradient background by clicking the random button.
* It also provides us the CSS code to use in our stylesheet so that we can incorporate the background to our website.
